## Documentation

- **Learning goals** <br/>
During our project, we successfully applied foundational Java concepts to a larger, more complex application, enhancing our understanding of object-oriented programming. We independently researched and integrated two additional Java topics to deepen our knowledge, using Java Swing to build an interactive user interface. Throughout the project, we collaborated effectively, developing our professional skills in teamwork and communication to coordinate tasks, solve issues together, and ensure cohesive progress. Overall, this experience strengthened both our technical skills in Java and our soft skills essential for successful team-based projects.
- **Topics of choice** <br/>
&emsp; **OOP** <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; We used a lot of different classes with some inheriting from the others. Our main game runs on a game panel and menu panel. On the game panel a lot of different game classes are used.
For example, the Entity class is the superclass of both the Player and Enemy class. The Enemy class is then again the superclass of EnemyBoss class. In addition, our Map class consists of a 2d array of GridCell.
GridCell is the superclass of Tower and Wall. By cleverly grouping classes together, we saved a lot of time and memory by not having to repeat code. <br/>
&emsp; **GIT** <br/>
&emsp; &emsp; We used git in order to efficiently be able to work seperately on features, etc. It also worked well to keep track of changes and which versions we were on.
