## Documentation

- **Learning goals** <br/>
During our project, we successfully applied foundational Java concepts to a larger, more complex application, enhancing our understanding of object-oriented programming. We independently researched and integrated two additional Java topics to deepen our knowledge, using Java Swing to build an interactive user interface. Throughout the project, we collaborated effectively, developing our professional skills in teamwork and communication to coordinate tasks, solve issues together, and ensure cohesive progress. Overall, this experience strengthened both our technical skills in Java and our soft skills essential for successful team-based projects.
